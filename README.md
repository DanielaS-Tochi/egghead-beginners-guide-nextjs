# The Beginner's Guide to Next JS

Hi there üëã Welcome to The Beginner's Guide to Next JS [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) course! üöÄ

## What do I need?

Before starting this course, you should be comfortable working with React, TypeScript, and understand basic Web Dev concepts.

Also, make sure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

## How do I start?

This is a monorepo. Each lesson is its own Next JS project and lives inside the `/lessons` folder. To get started, run `yarn` (or `npm install`) at the root (this installs all of the dependencies), `cd` into a certain lesson (`cd lessons/01`) and follow the instructions in the lesson's `README` file.

## Who are you?

My name is Lazar Nikolov and I'm a developer / designer from Skopje, North Macedonia üá≤üá∞! I work at [CodeChem](https://codechem.com), I'm a core member at [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), and I'm also an [egghead instructor](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-lazar-nikolov).

My first interaction with programming was back in 2011, while I was still in high school. I was learning HTML and CSS on my own, sometimes during the classes (don't tell my teachers ü§´). Throughout my career I've been developing mobile apps, TV apps, desktop apps, but I've found my sweet spot as a Full-stack Engineer working with the React ecosystem.

I'm a super friendly guy, so if you have any questions, or just want to talk to me, the best place to reach me is on Twitter at [@NikolovLazar](https://twitter.com/NikolovLazar).

I hope you like this course, and have fun learning ‚ù§Ô∏è
