# egghead.io: The Beginner's Guide to Next JS

This is the project that's part of the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) course The Beginner's Guide to Next JS.

## Usage

This is a monorepo. Each lesson is its own Next JS project and lives inside the `/lessons` folder. To get started, run `yarn` (or `npm install`) at the root (this installs all of the dependencies), `cd` into a certain lesson (`cd lessons/01`) and follow the instructions in the lesson's `README` file.
