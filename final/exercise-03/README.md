# Exercise 03: Create Dynamic Routes

## Background

We learned in the previous exercise that Next.js treats our files in the `pages/` directory as pages, and it automatically generates routes for us. But, what if we wanted to create a page with a dynamic route? You can add brackets around the page's name (`[pid].tsx`) to create a dynamic route.

Let's say we have a page in `pages/post/[pid].tsx`:

```typescript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { pid } = router.query

  return <p>Post: {pid}</p>
}

export default Post
```

Any route like `/post/1`, `/post/hello-world`, etc. will be matched by the `[pid].tsx` page. The dynamic parameter `pid` will be available to us as a query parameter through Next.js's router.

If we want to have a multi-segment dynamic route, we can wrap the folders' names with brackets too, for example `pages/post/[pid]/[comment].tsx`. The router's query will merge the two dynamic segments, so if we visited `/post/hello-world/love-it`, the `query` object will be:
```typescript
{ pid: "hello-world", comment: "love-it" }
```

## üöÄ Exercise

Create a genre page that will display the genre's name dynamically. Examples:
- `/rock`
- `/country`
- `/pop`

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Challenge

Make a new dynamic page that will display the artist's name and their music genre. Examples:
- `/rock/axl-rose` should display "axl-rose is a rock music artist!"
- `/country/chris-stapleton` should display "chris-stapleton is a country music artist!"
- `/pop/bruno-mars` should display "bruno-mars is a pop music artist!"
